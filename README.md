## 1. Login

### Research

The login page is for certain one of the most important design components of a website, it is a powerful tool that can help shape the user experience.

Since nowadays, almost everything on the web requires the user to have an account to access a service, it is mandatory to inspire a sense of security (Amelia). If this component is poorly designed, it will be perceived by the user as something sketchy and untrustful.

According to Rebeka Costa, a login design should be both easy to understand and require no thoughts from the user.

### Evaluation of guidelines

To develop this component, a minimum of two input fields are necessary; a username or email field, and a password field. To help the user signing in and prevent user errors, the form should alert the user for any mistakes, or missing data.

The login form should also let the users check their password if needed. This allows the user to feel more in control of its password, and therefore, its security.

### Planning and design prototype

To develop the component’s prototype, the first thing to consider was how the information should be grouped and presented to the user.

First, a simple white container was designed with round corners to better assist in being user-friendly. A header displaying the function of the form was created and separated from the rest of the form to give it more prominence. Labels and inputs were grouped so that their understanding is more noticeable.

Lastly, the “sign in” button was designed. Being the only object that has chromatic colour, it will grab the users attention to fill the required fields.

A dark “eye” icon was also added to the password input to reinforce the idea that the password visibility can be toggled at need.
